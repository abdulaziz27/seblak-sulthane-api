# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement focuses on improving the POS (Point of Sale) system with three key improvements: ensuring product image upload functionality works properly across web and mobile, implementing favorite product prioritization in the mobile app product listing, and adding optional order notes functionality for better order management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to upload product images through the web interface and have them display correctly in the mobile POS app, so that staff can easily identify products visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image in the web product form THEN the system SHALL store the image in the correct storage location
2. WHEN a user creates or updates a product with an image THEN the API SHALL return the correct image URL path
3. WHEN the mobile app requests product data THEN the API SHALL include the full accessible image URL for each product
4. WHEN no image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL handle null/empty image gracefully without errors
5. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file type (png, jpg, jpeg) and size constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cashier using the mobile POS app, I want favorite products to appear first in the product list, so that I can quickly access the most popular items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app requests the product list THEN the API SHALL return products ordered by favorite status first, then alphabetically by name
2. WHEN a product is marked as favorite in the web interface THEN it SHALL appear at the top of the mobile app product list
3. WHEN multiple products are marked as favorite THEN they SHALL be sorted alphabetically among themselves
4. WHEN no products are marked as favorite THEN the list SHALL display in alphabetical order by name
5. WHEN the API returns product data THEN it SHALL include the is_favorite field for each product

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want to add optional notes to orders through the mobile POS app, so that I can communicate special instructions or customer preferences to the kitchen staff.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an order through the mobile app THEN the system SHALL accept an optional notes field
2. WHEN notes are provided THEN the system SHALL store them with the order record
3. WHEN notes are not provided THEN the system SHALL accept null/empty notes without validation errors
4. WHEN retrieving order data THEN the API SHALL include the notes field in the response
5. WHEN notes exceed reasonable length THEN the system SHALL validate and limit the text length appropriately
6. WHEN displaying order information THEN the system SHALL show notes if they exist
